To provide a comprehensive financial analysis of Tesla, I will calculate and explain various financial ratios, growth metrics, and valuation metrics. I will primarily use the financial information from Tesla's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which can be found in their annual report.

First, I will calculate the profitability ratios to assess Tesla's ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, assets, and equity.

1. Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit / Revenue = $4,018 million / $43,857 million = 9.16%
2. Net Profit Margin: Net Income / Revenue = $2,324 million / $43,857 million = 5.30%
3. Return on Assets (ROA): Net Income / Average Total Assets = $2,324 million / ($43,857 million + $33,031 million) / 2 = 3.42%
4. Return on Equity (ROE): Net Income / Average Total Equity = $2,324 million / ($12,133 million + $6,833 million) / 2 = 21.54%

Next, I will calculate the liquidity ratios to evaluate Tesla's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its current assets.

1. Current Ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities = $22,234 million / $18,753 million = 1.18x
2. Quick Ratio: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = ($22,234 million - $11,631 million) / $18,753 million = 0.65x
3. Cash Ratio: Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities = $9,613 million / $18,753 million = 0.51x

Now, I will calculate the solvency ratios to determine Tesla's ability to meet its long-term obligations.

1. Debt to Equity Ratio: Total Debt / Average Total Equity = $26,184 million / ($12,133 million + $6,833 million) / 2 = 3.15x
2. Interest Coverage Ratio: EBIT / Interest Expense = $8,231 million / $675 million = 12.19x

Then, I will calculate the efficiency ratios to assess Tesla's ability to manage its assets and liabilities effectively.

1. Asset Turnover Ratio: Revenue / Average Total Assets = $43,857 million / ($43,857 million + $33,031 million) / 2 = 0.82x
2. Inventory Turnover: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory = $32,239 million / ($11,631 million + $6,533 million) / 2 = 6.11x
3. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): Accounts Receivable / (Revenue / 365) = $3,533 million / ($43,857 million / 365) = 25.34 days
4. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): Inventory / (Cost of Goods Sold / 365) = $11,631 million / ($32,239 million / 365) = 131.51 days
5. Payable Period (DPO): Accounts Payable / (Cost of Goods Sold / 365) = $5,533 million / ($32,239 million / 365) = 61.51 days

After that, I will analyze the growth metrics to understand Tesla's historical and projected growth trends.

1. Revenue Growth Rate (Year over Year): [(2021 Revenue - 2020 Revenue) / 2020 Revenue] x 100% = [($43,857 million - $24,576 million) / $24,576 million] x 100% = 78.45%
2. Net Income Growth Rate (Year over Year): [(2021 Net Income - 2020 Net Income) / 2020 Net Income] x 100% = [($2,324 million - $721 million) / $721 million] x 100% = 220.59%

Lastly, I will calculate the valuation metrics to evaluate Tesla's stock price in relation to its earnings, revenue, and growth potential.

1. Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio: Stock Price / EPS = $1,145 / $9.85 = 116.09x
2. Price to Sales (PS) Ratio: Stock Price / Revenue per Share = $1,145 / ($43,857 million / 943 million shares) = 2.64x
3. Price to Book (PB) Ratio: Stock Price / Book Value per Share = $1,145 / ($12,133 million / 943 million shares) = 9.81x
4. Market Capitalization / Revenue = $1,013.21 billion / $43,857 million = 23.09x
5. Market Capitalization / Net Income = $1,013.21 billion / $2,324 million = 436.11x
