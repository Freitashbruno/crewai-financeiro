To provide a comprehensive financial analysis of Petrobras, I will calculate and explain various financial ratios, growth metrics, and valuation metrics.

Thought: I'll start with the profitability ratios.

Profitability Ratios:
1. Return on Equity (ROE): ROE is calculated by dividing net income by shareholder's equity. A higher ROE indicates a more profitable company. For Petrobras, ROE (TTM) is $2.33 / ($55.33B / 6.00B) = 2.21%. This indicates that for every dollar of shareholder's equity, Petrobras generates $0.0221 in net income.
2. Return on Assets (ROA): ROA is calculated by dividing net income by total assets. For Petrobras, ROA (TTM) is $2.33B / $161.53B = 1.44%. This means Petrobras generates $0.0144 in net income for every dollar in assets.
3. Net Margin: Net margin is calculated by dividing net income by revenue. For Petrobras, net margin (TTM) is $2.33B / $91.55B = 2.55%. This means Petrobras retains $0.0255 of every dollar in revenue as net income.

Thought: Now I'll move on to the liquidity ratios.

Liquidity Ratios:
1. Current Ratio: The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. For Petrobras, the current ratio is ($31.15B / $23.15B) = 1.34. This means Petrobras has $1.34 of current assets to cover each dollar in current liabilities.
2. Quick Ratio: The quick ratio is calculated by dividing quick assets (current assets - inventory) by current liabilities. For Petrobras, the quick ratio is ($21.53B / $23.15B) = 0.93. This means Petrobras has $0.93 of quick assets to cover each dollar in current liabilities.
3. Cash Ratio: The cash ratio is calculated by dividing cash and cash equivalents by current liabilities. For Petrobras, the cash ratio is ($11.53B / $23.15B) = 0.50. This means Petrobras has $0.50 of cash and cash equivalents to cover each dollar in current liabilities.

Thought: Next, I'll analyze the solvency ratios.

Solvency Ratios:
1. Debt to Equity Ratio: The debt to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholder's equity. For Petrobras, the debt to equity ratio is ($96.18B / $55.33B) = 1.74. This means Petrobras has $1.74 in total liabilities for every dollar in shareholder's equity.
2. Interest Coverage Ratio: The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing EBIT by interest expense. For Petrobras, the interest coverage ratio is $11.55B / $2.33B = 4.96. This means Petrobras generates $4.96 in EBIT for every dollar in interest expense.

Thought: Now I'll examine the efficiency ratios.

Efficiency Ratios:
1. Asset Turnover Ratio: The asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing revenue by total assets. For Petrobras, the asset turnover ratio is $91.55B / $161.53B = 0.57. This means Petrobras generates $0.57 in revenue for every dollar in assets.
2. Inventory Turnover: Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing COGS by average inventory. For Petrobras, inventory turnover is $51.55B / ($5.53B / 2) = 9.31. This means Petrobras sells and replaces its inventory 9.31 times in a year.
3. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): DSO is calculated by dividing 365 by the accounts receivable turnover ratio. For Petrobras, DSO is 365 / (($91.55B - $51.55B) / ($6.00B / 2)) = 31.14 days. This means, on average, Petrobras takes 31.14 days to collect its accounts receivable.

Thought: I'll continue with the growth metrics.

Growth Metrics:
1. Revenue Growth Rate: The revenue growth rate is calculated by comparing the current period's revenue to the previous period's revenue. For Petrobras, the revenue growth rate (TTM) is not provided.
2. Net Income Growth Rate: The net income growth rate is calculated by comparing the current period's net income to the previous period's net income. For Petrobras, the net income growth rate (TTM) is not provided.
3. EPS Growth Rate: The EPS growth rate is calculated by comparing the current period's EPS to the previous period's EPS. For Petrobras, the EPS growth rate (TTM) is not provided.

Thought: Lastly, I'll discuss the valuation metrics.

Valuation Metrics:
1. Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by EPS. For Petrobras, the P/E ratio (TTM) is $9.32 / $2.33 = 4.00x. This means investors pay $4.00 for every dollar in earnings.
2. Price to Sales (P/S) Ratio: The P/S ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by revenue per share. For Petrobras, the P/S ratio (TTM) is $9.32 / ($91.55B / 6.00B) = 0.10x.
3. Price to Book (P/B) Ratio: The P/B ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the book value per share. For Petrobras, the P/B ratio (TTM) is $9.32 / (($161.53B - $96.18B) / 6.00B) = 0.15x.

Thought: I have now calculated and explained all the relevant financial ratios, growth metrics, and valuation metrics for Petrobras. This information should provide a thorough financial analysis of the company.
